  - contributes to: GOAL-PKL-PURE
  - body: _not yet implemented_

- [ ] **support Pkl comments and module property forward references** — verifies: PKL-012
  > The lexer preserves line/block comments as trivia, and module property evaluation/typechecking resolves sibling properties regardless of declaration order.

  - decisions: 1 entry(ies)
  - body: _not yet implemented_

- [ ] **support Pkl imports and module resolution** (critical) — verifies: PKL-006

  - body: _not yet implemented_

- [ ] **support Pkl local module bindings and import expressions** — verifies: PKL-014

  - contributes to: GOAL-PKL-PURE
  - decisions: 1 entry(ies)
  - body: _not yet implemented_

- [ ] **support Pkl object body property shorthand** — verifies: PKL-013

  - decisions: 1 entry(ies)
  - body: _not yet implemented_

- [ ] **support Pkl standard library surface** — verifies: PKL-007

  - contributes to: GOAL-PKL-PURE
  - decisions: 1 entry(ies)
  - body: _not yet implemented_

- [ ] **support Pkl string escape compatibility** — verifies: PKL-010

  - decisions: 1 entry(ies)
  - body: _not yet implemented_

- [ ] **support initial Pkl object and module syntax** (critical) — verifies: PKL-005

  - decisions: 1 entry(ies)
  - body: _not yet implemented_

- [ ] **support module extends amends and object amendments** (critical) — verifies: PKL-020 — tags: parser, evaluator, typechecker

- [ ] **typecheck incrementally through ripple dependency graph** (critical) — verifies: PKL-021 — tags: typechecker, incremental, ripple

  - depends on: PKL-004, PKL-006, PKL-020
  - decisions: 2 entry(ies)
  - body: _not yet implemented_

- [ ] **use upstream apple/pkl fixtures as compatibility checks** — verifies: PKL-011
  > The contract suite references Apple's Pkl repository as a git submodule and runs selected upstream LanguageSnippetTests fixtures through the pure MoonBit CLI.
