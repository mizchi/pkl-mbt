  - body: _not yet implemented_

- [ ] **support Pkl local module bindings and import expressions** — verifies: PKL-014

  - body: _not yet implemented_

- [ ] **support initial Pkl object and module syntax** (critical) — verifies: PKL-005

## Outstanding questions

- **PKL-016** — Should unsupported ranges be exposed as diagnostics, CST node metadata, or a separate parser coverage report?
- **PKL-016** — Which upstream fixtures should become the first zero-UnsupportedExpr acceptance set?
- **PKL-019** — Should function bodies be represented before function evaluation exists?
- **PKL-019** — What minimum class model is enough to typecheck object literals against declared properties?
- **PKL-018** — Should evaluator support be added in the same slice, or should this first be parser-only AST coverage?
- **PKL-018** — Which operators should remain parse-only until the typechecker has richer Pkl semantics?
- **PKL-017** — Start with Listing and Mapping literals only, or include object member spread and computed keys in the same slice?
- **PKL-017** — What public Value and Type shapes should represent ordered listings and keyed mappings?
- **PKL-020** — Should amends resolution be implemented before class inheritance, or share one merge model?
- **PKL-020** — Which apple/pkl fixtures should become the first executable amends golden cases?
